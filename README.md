Long-read metagenomic sequencing negates inferred loss of cytosine methylation in Myxosporea (Cnidaria: Myxozoa) | GigaScience | Oxford Academic
Suggested that DNA methylation was present in some myxozoan genomes that were newly assembled using ONT. Specifically, they indicated that out of the newly assembled genomes of specimen 57, 58, 70, 108 and 115, sample 57 and 58 have large numbers of methylated genes. Their inference was based on 1) ONT methylation calls (Figure 6), 2) presence of DNA methylation proteins (Table 3), 3) skew in CpG O/E (Table 4 and Figure 8B). 

These results are in contrast to our published paper (https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/2/393/5902833) in which we proposed the lack of DNA methylation myxozoa, based on 1) lack of DNA methylation enzymes in myxozoa (Figure 1), and 2) lack of methylated Cs from WGBS (Table 1 and Figures 2 and 3).
